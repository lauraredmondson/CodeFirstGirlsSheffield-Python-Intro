## API Projects

### TopTrumps game

In this project you'll create a small game where players compare stats, similar to the Top
Trumps card game. The basic flow of the games is:

1. You are given a random card with different stats
1. You select one of the card's stats
1. Another random card is selected for your opponent (the computer)
1. The stats of the two cards are compared
1. The player with the stat higher than their opponent wins.

The standard project will use the Pokemon API, but you can use a different API if you want
after completing the required tasks.

You will not need any additional knowledge beyond what is covered in this course to complete
this project.

#### Required Tasks
These are the required tasks for this project. You should aim to complete these tasks before
adding your own ideas to the project.

1. Generate a random number between 1 and 151 to use as the Pokemon ID number
2. Using the Pokemon API get a Pokemon based on its ID number
3. Create a dictionary that contains the returned Pokemon's name, id, height and weight
(<https://pokeapi.co/>)
4. Get a random Pokemon for the player and another for their opponent
5. Ask the user which stat they want to use (id, height or weight)
6. Compare the player's and opponent's Pokemon on the chosen stat to decide who wins

#### Ideas for Extending the Project
Here are a few ideas for extending the project beyond the required tasks. These ideas are just
suggestions, feel free to come up with your own ideas and extend the program however you
want.

- Use different stats for the Pokemon from the API

- Get multiple random Pokemon and let the player decide which one that they want to
use

- Play multiple rounds and record the outcome of each round. The player with most
number of rounds won, wins the game

- Allow the opponent (computer) to choose a stat that they would like to compare

- Record high scores for players and store them in a file

- Use a different API (see suggestions below)

#### Useful Resources


##### Star Wars API
- Homepage <https://swapi.co/>

#### Example Project Code
In this section you will find some example code to complete the required tasks. You can use
this code for guidance if you are finding it difficult to complete the required tasks for this
project.

```python
import random
import requests

def random_pokemon ():
    pokemon_number = random.randint(1, 151)
    url = 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{}/'.format(pokemon_number)
    response = requests.get(url)
    pokemon = response.json()
    return {
        'name': pokemon['name'],
        'id': pokemon['id'],
        'height': pokemon['height'],
        'weight': pokemon['weight'],
    }

def run ():
    my_pokemon = random_pokemon()
    print('You were given {}'.format(my_pokemon['name']))
    stat_choice = input('Which stat do you want to use? (id, height,
    weight) ')
    opponent_pokemon = random_pokemon()
    print('The opponent chose {}'.format(opponent_pokemon['name']))
    my_stat = my_pokemon[stat_choice]
    opponent_stat = opponent_pokemon[stat_choice]
    if my_stat > opponent_stat:
        print('You Win!')
    elif my_stat < opponent_stat:
        print('You Lose!')
    else :
        print('Draw!')

run()
```

### Cryptocurrency converter
In this project you will investigate different cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, and many
more). There is an option to analyse data on the coins (such as current prices, total numbers of coins
circulation) and/or create a cryptocurrency price converter.

#### Project setup: 
1. Sign up for an API key here: <https://coinmarketcap.com/api/>
Please select the basic account which is free.

1. Add the API key and ID to your PyCharm Environment variables. See Week 6 slides for instructions.

#### Meaning of API data categories:

- "cmc_rank": Rank of coin values

- "max_supply": Maximum possible number of coins (circulating and non-circulating)

- "name": name of the coin

- "symbol": symbol of the coin eg. BTC

- "market_cap": Total value of circulating coins in USD

- "percent_change_1h": Percentage price change in last hour

- "percent_change_24h": Percentage price change in last 24 hours

- "percent_change_7d": Percentage price change in last 7 days

- "price": Current price

- "volume_24h": Total value of coins exchanged in 24 hours


#### Some initial ideas for data analysis:

- Return the names of the top 10 cryptocurrencies for price, volume and market cap.

- Create a crypto price to USD converter. Ask the user for the name of the cryptocurrency and how
many coins they have. Write a function to find this cryptocurrencies price in USD, and return the total
value of the userâ€™s coins in USD.

#### Example code:
```python
from pprint import pprint
from requests import Session
import json
import os

api_key = os.environ.get("crypto_api_key")

url = 'https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/cryptocurrency/listings/latest'
parameters = {
    'start': '1',
    'limit': '2000', # number of returned coins from the request
    'convert': 'USD' # currency the value is returned in
}
headers = {
    'Accepts': 'application/json',
    'X-CMC_PRO_API_KEY': api_key,
}

session = Session()
session.headers.update(headers)

response = session.get(url, params=parameters)
crypto_dict = json.loads(response.text)['data']
pprint(crypto_dict)

# print the names of all the coins and their value
for coin in crypto_dict:
    coin_price_usd = coin['quote']['USD']['price'] # get the value in USD
    print('{} is worth ${:.2f}'.format(coin['name'], coin_price_usd))#print the value in USD

```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Recipe Generator
In this project you'll create a program to search for recipes based on an ingredient. The
standard project uses the Edamam API, but can be changed to use a different API after
completing the required tasks.

You will not need any additional knowledge beyond what is covered in this course to complete
this project.

#### Project set up
1. Read the Edamam API documentation <https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api>

1. Sign up for an API key and API ID. Select 'Recipe Search' API- Developer.

1. Add the API key and ID to your PyCharm Environment variables. See Week 6 slides for instructions.

#### Required Tasks
These are the required tasks for this project. You should aim to complete these tasks before
adding your own ideas to the project.
 
1. Ask the user to enter an ingredient that they want to search for

1. Create a function that makes a request to the Edamam API with the required
ingredient as part of the search query

1. Get the returned recipes from the API response

1. Display the recipes for each search result

#### Ideas for Extending the Project
Here are a few ideas for extending the project beyond the required tasks. These ideas are just
suggestions, feel free to come up with your own ideas and extend the program however you
want.

- Save the search results to a text file (Titles, URLs, Ingredients list)

- Ask the user additional questions to decide which recipe they should choose, for example, dietary requirements

##### How to use additional requirements in the search

###### Dietary
In the free API, you can use the following diet labels:
balanced, high-protein, low-carb, low-fat

You can query a dietary requirement using by adding ```&diet={}```

```python
result = requests.get('https://api.edamam.com/search?q={}&diet={}&
                        app_id={}&app_key={}'.format(ingredient, diet, api_id, api_key))
```

###### Health
In the free API, you can use the following health labels:
vegan, vegetarian, sugar-conscious, peanut-free, tree-nut-free,  alcohol-free

You can query a dietary requirement using by adding ```&health={}```
```python
result = requests.get('https://api.edamam.com/search?q={}&health={}&
                        app_id={}&app_key={}'.format(ingredient, health, api_id, api_key))
```

Please note that some filters such as dietType and CuisineType are not available. 

#### Example Code
In this section you will find some example code to complete the required tasks. You can use
this code for guidance if you are finding it difficult to complete the required tasks for this
project.

```python
import requests
import os

# Register to get an API key https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api
api_id = os.environ.get("edamam_api_id")
api_key = os.environ.get("edamam_api_key")

def recipe_search (ingredient):
    result = requests.get('https://api.edamam.com/search?
            q={}&app_id={}&app_key={}'.format(ingredient, api_id, api_key))
    data = result.json()
    return data['hits']

def run ():
    ingredient = input('Enter an ingredient: ')
    recipes = recipe_search(ingredient)
    for recipe in recipes:
        print(recipe['recipe']['label'])
        print(recipe['recipe']['url'])
        print()

run()
```
